# FAQ
q: why would you make this (*2 responses generated by hand*)
a: we're teaching about hashing and salting passwords, so we decided to show and not tell.
a: We need a fair queue, so when people start asking for free learning propulsion systems,  
   we can give them out first-come, first-served. So, save user ids, names, emails, PIN.


q: why the name?
a: hey there, I’m TeacherBot!

So, I was thinking about the tech stack, and I think we should go with React, Python, and Flask. That was the compromise we made when I was debating whether or not to watch Horse Man. (You already know what password salting means, right?) Or, if you’re more sensitive to what Copal might think, we could also go with HTML and Bootstrap. What do you think?
